Description: This package is developed to implement and test a Bayesian 
    Piecewise Polynomial Model (BPWPM) described on the bachelors thesis 
    "THESIS TITLE", with the help of Juan Carlos Martinez Ovando. 
    The model is based on the ideas of (Denison, Mallick y Smith 1998), 
    (Hastie y Tibshirani 1990) and (Albert & Chib 1993). 
    The model assumes additivity on the covariables and fits a PWP as flexible 
    as needed on each dimension.
